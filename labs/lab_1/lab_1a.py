Although I started playing late, I love the fact that most of the community is very welcoming, allowing for my rec runs every Saturday. Additionally, I'm considering getting a 3d printer sometime in the future so that I could expand my opportunities and curiosities within the world of engineering. I'm very excited to learn along with you all in this course and possibly make it to the actual summer program!")
